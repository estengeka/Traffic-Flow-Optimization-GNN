# Traffic-Flow-Optimization-GNN
This project explores the application of GNNs to the problem of urban traffic flow optimization in two different urban contexts: New York City and Kampala, Uganda. The goal is to build a predictive model that can understand complex traffic patterns on road networks andmaybe inform strategies for reducing congestion, travel times, and emissions.
